An object is a value in memory which is possibly referenced by an [identifier](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Identifier)
[[Propreties]]

## Initialization
There are two basic ways to create an empty object:
```
var obj = new Object();
```

Copy to Clipboard

And:

```
var obj = {};
```

The following example creates an object prototype(`Person`) and an instance of that prototype(`you`).
```
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

// Define an object
var you = new Person('You', 24);
// We are creating a new person named "You" aged 24.
```

```
function Person(first, last) {
  this.first = first;
  this.last = last;
}
Person.prototype.fullName = function() {
  return this.first + ' ' + this.last;
};
Person.prototype.fullNameReversed = function() {
  return this.last + ', ' + this.first;
};
```

`Person.prototype` is an object shared by all instances of `Person`. It forms part of a lookup chain (that has a special name, "prototype chain"): any time you attempt to access a property of `Person` that isn't set, JavaScript will check `Person.prototype` to see if that property exists there instead. As a result, anything assigned to `Person.prototype` becomes available to all instances of that constructor via the `this` object.


This is an incredibly powerful tool. JavaScript lets you modify something's prototype at any time in your program, which means you can add extra methods to existing objects at runtime:

```
var s = new Person('Simon', 'Willison');
s.firstNameCaps(); // TypeError on line 1: s.firstNameCaps is not a function

Person.prototype.firstNameCaps = function() {
  return this.first.toUpperCase();
};
s.firstNameCaps(); // "SIMON"
```

Interestingly, you can also add things to the prototype of built-in JavaScript objects. Let's add a method to `String` that returns that string in reverse:

```
var s = 'Simon';
s.reversed(); // TypeError on line 1: s.reversed is not a function

String.prototype.reversed = function() {
  var r = '';
  for (var i = this.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    r += this[i];
  }
  return r;
};

s.reversed(); // nomiS
```

```
function trivialNew(constructor, ...args) {
  var o = {}; // Create an object
  constructor.apply(o, args);
  return o;
}
```

Copy to Clipboard

This isn't an exact replica of `new` as it doesn't set up the prototype chain (it would be difficult to illustrate). This is not something you use very often, but it's useful to know about. In this snippet, `...args` (including the ellipsis) is called the "[rest arguments](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters)" â€” as the name implies, this contains the rest of the arguments.

Calling

```
var bill = trivialNew(Person, 'William', 'Orange');
```

Copy to Clipboard

is therefore almost equivalent to

```
var bill = new Person('William', 'Orange');
```

## Acces Object
**Once created**, an object's properties can again be accessed in one of two ways:

```
// dot notation
obj.name = 'Simon';
var name = obj.name;
```

Copy to Clipboard

And...

```
// bracket notation
obj['name'] = 'Simon';
var name = obj['name'];
// can use a variable to define a key
var user = prompt('what is your key?')
obj[user] = prompt('what is its value?')
```

**Note:** Starting in ECMAScript 2015, object keys can be defined by the variable using bracket notation upon being created. `{[phoneType]: 12345}` is possible instead of just `var userPhone = {}; userPhone[phoneType] = 12345`.
