In [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript), a **primitive** (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an [object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Object) and has no [methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Method).

- All primitives are **immutable**, i.e., they cannot be altered. The variable may be reassigned a new value, but the existing value can not be changed in the ways that objects, arrays, and functions can be altered.

* Except for `null` and `undefined`, all primitive values have object equivalents that wrap around the primitive values.
All Primitive types:
* [[Null]]
* [[Undefined]]
*  [[Number]]
* [[BigInt]]
*  [[String]]
*  [[Boolean]]
* [[Symbol]]
