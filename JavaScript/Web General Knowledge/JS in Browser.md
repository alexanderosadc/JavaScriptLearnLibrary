When you load web page, you are runnin your code inside an **execution environment** (browser tab).
**Execution environment** - the code in each tab is run completely separately, and the code in one tab cannot directly affect the code in another tab â€” or on another website.

**JS is lightweight interpreted language** - the web browser receives the JavaScript code in its original text form and runs the script from that. From a technical standpoint, most modern JavaScript interpreters actually use a technique called **just-in-time compiling** to improve performance. The JavaScript source code gets compiled into a faster, binary format while the script is being used, so that it can be run as quickly as possible. However, JavaScript is still considered an interpreted language, since the compilation is handled at run time, rather than ahead of time.

**Just in Time Compiling** - is a way of executing [computer code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_code "Computer code") that involves [compilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler "Compiler") during execution of a program (at [run time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_time_(program_lifecycle_phase) "Run time (program lifecycle phase)")) rather than before execution.
