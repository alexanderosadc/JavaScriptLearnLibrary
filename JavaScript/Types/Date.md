When representing dates, the best choice is to use the built-in [`Date` utility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) in JavaScript.
* JavaScript **`Date`** objects represent a single moment in time in a platform-independent format. `Date` objects contain a `Number` that represents milliseconds since 1 January 1970 UTC.
