[Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) are regular objects for which there is a particular relationship between integer-keyed properties and the `length` property.
[Typed Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays) are new to JavaScript with ECMAScript 2015, and present an array-like view of an underlying binary data buffer.
